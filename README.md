# Gazi-University-Website
This is a simple personal website made in the format of Gazi University website for BM104 (Bilgisayar Programlamaya Giriş) lecture.

Please open the "website.html", there you will see the main page of the website. There is a menu on the left, if you click the titles there, you can see the other pages.

If you click on the LinkedIn symbol, you will be directed to my LinkedIn profile.
